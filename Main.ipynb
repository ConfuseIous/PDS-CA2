T-Bills are a financial instrument that the U.S Government uses to control the amount of money in circulation. Investors buy T-Bills from the government at a discount to the face value (the amount that the government will pay back when the T-Bill matures). The difference between the face value and the purchase price is the interest that the investor earns when the T-Bill matures.\n",

    "T-Bills are considered risk-free investments because the US Government is extremely unlikely to default on its loans. They are sold at different lengths of time to maturity, from 4 to 52 weeks. Longer maturities generally pay higher interest rates, as investors demand more compensation for the risk of holding the investment for a longer period of time. We will hence consider only the 52 week T-Bill for our analysis as it is the longest maturity available.\n",

    "However, there are two columns for 52 week bills - \"52 WEEKS BANK DISCOUNT\" and \"52 WEEKS COUPON EQUIVALENT\".

The latter is the equivalent interest rate that the investor would earn if the T-Bill paid interest every 6 months. To avoid confusion, we will stick with the \"52 WEEKS BANK DISCOUNT\" column."
