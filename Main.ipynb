    "The ***Gold Spot Prices*** dataset records gold prices (per ounce) from 1978 to 2023. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and is considered a safe haven asset due to its scarcity and its value in jewelry and electronics. This low risk profile makes gold a popular choice during times of economic uncertainty.\n",

    "For maximum precision and granularity, we will use the \"Daily\" sheet, as this contains daily prices. The first 5 rows contain metadata, so we will skip them. The first 2 columns are empty and purely for formatting, so we will skip them as well. The remaining columns contain the Date, and the prices in various currencies. We will only use the USD column for a more consistent comparison with the other datasets."

    "The ***U.S. Department of the Treasury - Interest Rates Data CSV Archive*** contains data about US Treasury Bill interest rates. T-Bills are a financial instrument that the U.S Government uses to control the amount of money in circulation. Investors buy T-Bills from the government at a discount to the face value (the amount that the government will pay back when the T-Bill matures). The difference between the face value and the purchase price is the interest that the investor earns when the T-Bill matures.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Bills are considered risk-free investments because the US Government is extremely unlikely to default on its loans. They are sold at different lengths of time to maturity, from 4 to 52 weeks. Longer maturities generally pay higher interest rates, as investors demand more compensation for the risk of holding the investment for a longer period of time. We will hence consider only the 52 week T-Bill for our analysis as it is the longest maturity available.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two columns for 52 week bills - \"52 WEEKS BANK DISCOUNT\" and \"52 WEEKS COUPON EQUIVALENT\". T-Bills only pay out at the end of the investment, and this is what the former represents. The latter is the equivalent interest rate that the investor would earn if the T-Bill paid interest every 6 months. To avoid confusion, we will stick with the \"52 WEEKS BANK DISCOUNT\" column."
