    "From the results, we can see that the Straits Times Index consistently underperformed all other non-cash assets in the portfolio, but it did beat inflation. This should be expected, as The Straits Times Index consists of mainly banks and real estate companies. These companies are not expected to perform well in a low interest rate environment, like the one from 2010 to 2022.\n",

    "For better results, the investor could have invested in Gold, which benefitted from uncertainty in the market in 2008-2012 (owing to the Global Financial Crisis) and 2020-2022 (owing to the COVID-19 pandemic). The investor would have considerably more money if they had invested in Gold instead of the Straits Times Index, at 706,000 USD.\n",

    "Our selected Mutual Fund did even better, ending at 864,000 USD. This can be attributed to the fact that the Fidelity Growth Company Fund invests in companies that are expected to grow at a faster rate than the market. This is a good strategy to use in a low interest rate environment, as investors are more willing to take on risk in order to get higher returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite being professionally managed, the Mutual Fund still failed to beat the S&P 500, which ended at 960,000 USD. The difference is even larger if we account for the management fee that Mutual Funds tend to charge. This shows that even professionals are unable to consistently beat the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emerging Markets were the best performing asset in the portfolio, ending at 973,000 USD. This can be attributed to the rapid economic advancements in India. India was also not hit as hard by the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, as it was not as integrated into the global economy as it is today. This allowed India to continue growing, while the U.S was in a recession. Similarly, the U.S entered a smaller recession in late 2021 due to high inflation, but India was not affected as much.\n",

The Sharpe ratio divides a portfolio's excess returns (the returns above the risk-free rate, which we approximate with 52-week Treasury bills) by the portfolio's volatility (quantified by the standard deviation of returns).

The NIFTY50 has a higher Sharpe ratio than the S&P 500, but also a much higher volatility, making it the best investment choice for risk-seeking investors. This could be why the NIFTY50 has the highest returns. The STI has a negative Sharpe ratio, making it the worst investment choice.\n",

    "- In our analysis, we assumed that the investor paid $0 in fees and commissions, and that they had the ability to purchase fractional shares. However, zero commission trading and fractional shares are both relatively new developments.\n",
    "- We did not consider dividends in our analysis. Dividends are a way for companies to return profits to shareholders and can sometimes be significant, but they are not considered in this analysis as they can also bring additonal tax implications, which are outside the scope of this analysis.\n",
    "- Past performance is not indicative of future results. While we have made every effort to understand the historical performance of the stocks in our analysis, it is not guaranteed that they will perform in the same way in the future, so we are at best operating on educated assumptions. Ideally, we would update our analysis with new data on a regular basis to ensure that our assumptions are still valid."
